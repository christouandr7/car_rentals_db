# car_rentals_db

In this group project we used the relational database MariaDB (SQL) in order to implement an application for car rentals to be used in a car rentals chain. A graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented in Java as well. In this application each employee could enter in the database the vehicle reservations as well as the customer details or any other problems the cars have. A complete car rental application was implemented. 

In collaboration with [Andreas Kouzapas](https://github.com/kouzapas17) and Kyriacos Papavasiliou.
